I am Gitasuk "Arthur" Jur and I am a senior computer engineering student. I am taking this class because I want to take some classes on topics I didn't know much about so I know what to do for my future career. I am still don't have any specific interests in the field of computer science I simply chose a computer related major because I already spend a lot of time on a computer (mostly playing League of Legends, where I have peaked challenger.)
